    "content": "The 2024 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart Failure Guideline provides comprehensive recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of heart failure. Key recommendations include: (1) Use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) regardless of diabetes status, (2) Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) as preferred therapy over ACE inhibitors or ARBs in appropriate patients, (3) Beta-blockers should be initiated and titrated in all patients with HFrEF, (4) Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are recommended in patients with HFrEF who remain symptomatic despite optimal therapy.",
