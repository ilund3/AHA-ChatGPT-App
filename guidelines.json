    "title": "AHA Website - Understanding Cholesterol Levels",
    "content": "The American Heart Association provides detailed information about cholesterol levels and what they mean. Cholesterol is a waxy substance found throughout the body. Your body needs cholesterol to build cells, but too much can be a problem. There are different types of cholesterol: LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is 'bad' cholesterol that can build up in arteries; HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is 'good' cholesterol that helps remove LDL from arteries; Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. Desirable cholesterol levels are: Total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dL; LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL (or less than 70 mg/dL for people at very high risk); HDL cholesterol 60 mg/dL or higher; Triglycerides less than 150 mg/dL. High cholesterol typically has no symptoms, so it's important to have it checked regularly with a simple blood test. Lifestyle changes including a heart-healthy diet (low in saturated and trans fats), regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and limiting alcohol can help manage cholesterol. Medications such as statins may also be needed. The AHA emphasizes working with healthcare providers to determine the best approach for managing cholesterol based on individual risk factors.",

    "title": "AHA Website - Heart Failure Types and Stages",
    "content": "The American Heart Association explains that heart failure can be classified in different ways. Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) occurs when the heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump blood effectively. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) occurs when the heart muscle is stiff and cannot fill with blood properly. The AHA also uses a staging system: Stage A (at risk but no symptoms or structural heart disease), Stage B (structural heart disease but no symptoms), Stage C (structural heart disease with current or past symptoms), and Stage D (advanced heart failure with symptoms despite maximum medical therapy). Symptoms may include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs/ankles/feet, rapid or irregular heartbeat, persistent cough, increased need to urinate at night, swelling of the abdomen, rapid weight gain, lack of appetite, or difficulty concentrating. Treatment depends on the type and stage and may include medications (ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, SGLT2 inhibitors), lifestyle changes (low-sodium diet, fluid restriction, regular exercise), and in some cases, medical devices or surgery. The AHA emphasizes that heart failure is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management and close collaboration with healthcare providers.",

    "title": "AHA Website - Stroke Types and Causes",
    "content": "The American Heart Association explains that there are different types of stroke. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain, accounting for about 87% of all strokes. Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, accounting for about 13% of strokes. Transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a 'mini-stroke,' occurs when blood flow to the brain is temporarily blocked. TIAs are warning signs that a more serious stroke may occur. Common causes of stroke include high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, atherosclerosis, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, and excessive alcohol use. The AHA emphasizes the importance of recognizing stroke symptoms using the FAST acronym: F - Face drooping, A - Arm weakness, S - Speech difficulty, T - Time to call 911. Additional symptoms may include sudden confusion, trouble seeing, trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or sudden severe headache. Immediate treatment is critical - every minute counts. The AHA emphasizes that many strokes can be prevented through managing risk factors and living a heart-healthy lifestyle.",

    "content": "The American Heart Association emphasizes that stroke recovery is a lifelong process that begins as soon as medical treatment stabilizes the person. Recovery varies greatly depending on the type and severity of stroke, the area of the brain affected, and individual factors. Early rehabilitation is crucial and typically begins in the hospital as soon as the person is stable. Rehabilitation may include physical therapy to improve movement and strength, occupational therapy to help with daily activities, speech therapy to address communication and swallowing problems, and psychological support to help with emotional and mental health challenges. The AHA emphasizes that recovery can continue for months or years after a stroke, and progress may be gradual. Support from family, friends, and healthcare providers is essential. The AHA provides resources for stroke survivors and their caregivers, including information about support groups, rehabilitation programs, and strategies for adapting to life after stroke. Preventing another stroke is also a key focus, which includes managing risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and following a heart-healthy lifestyle.",

    "content": "The American Heart Association emphasizes that recovery from a heart attack begins in the hospital and continues at home. The recovery process typically includes medical treatment, lifestyle changes, cardiac rehabilitation, and emotional support. In the hospital, treatment focuses on stabilizing the person, restoring blood flow to the heart, and preventing complications. After leaving the hospital, recovery involves taking medications as prescribed, making lifestyle changes (healthy diet, regular exercise, quitting smoking, managing stress), participating in cardiac rehabilitation, and attending follow-up appointments. Cardiac rehabilitation is a medically supervised program that includes exercise training, education, and counseling. The AHA recommends cardiac rehab for most people who have had a heart attack, as it can reduce the risk of another heart attack and improve quality of life. Emotional support is also important, as many people experience anxiety, depression, or fear after a heart attack. The AHA provides resources for heart attack survivors and their families, including information about support groups and strategies for managing the emotional aspects of recovery. Preventing another heart attack is a key focus, which includes managing risk factors and following a heart-healthy lifestyle.",

If you have a close relative (parent, sibling, or child) who had heart disease or stroke at an early age (men before age 55, women before age 65), your risk may be increased. However, having a family history doesn't mean you will definitely develop heart disease. Many risk factors are modifiable, meaning you can take steps to reduce your risk even if you have a family history. The AHA recommends sharing your family history with your healthcare provider, who can help assess your risk and develop a prevention plan. Key strategies for people with a family history include: knowing your numbers (blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar), maintaining a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, not smoking), managing other risk factors, and getting regular check-ups. Genetic testing may be recommended in some cases, particularly for certain inherited conditions. The AHA emphasizes that even with a family history, many heart disease and stroke events can be prevented through healthy lifestyle choices and proper medical care.",

The AHA also recommends regular check-ups to monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health indicators. Some children may have congenital heart defects or other heart conditions that require special care.

The AHA emphasizes that it's never too late to make positive changes. Even small improvements in diet, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors can have significant benefits.

The AHA emphasizes that medications work best when taken exactly as prescribed, and it's important not to stop taking medications without talking to your healthcare provider. People should know the names of their medications, what they're for, how and when to take them, possible side effects, and what to do if they miss a dose.
